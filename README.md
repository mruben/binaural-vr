This VR application is based on sound viewing and sound morphology handling in a virtual environment.
The user is able to see and to handle a virtual object which synchronized image and sound. A visual property (shape, color, location) is synchronized with a sound attribute (pitch, tone modulation, location). It uses a part of Hoa library (MAX/MSP objects destined to high order ambisonic sound reproduction) to spatialize sound.

# To test this VR experience you need:
* HTC Vive
* headphones
* Touch Designer 0.99
* Max 7 and HOA library (in lib directory)

First run the Touch Designer patch, press F1 to enter perform mode, then run the MaxMSP patch.
